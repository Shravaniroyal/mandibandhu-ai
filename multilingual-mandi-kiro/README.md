# MandiBandhu  
AI-Powered Negotiation Assistant for India’s Local Markets

## Problem Statement
India’s local markets (mandis) operate primarily in regional languages.  
While buyers often have access to pricing information and bargaining power, small vendors frequently face disadvantages due to:

- Language barriers
- Information asymmetry
- Unfair price anchoring
- Lack of real-time negotiation support

As a result, vendors often lose 15–20% of their potential income despite fair market demand.

## Solution Overview
MandiBandhu is an AI-powered, culturally intelligent negotiation assistant designed for Indian local market vendors.

Rather than acting as a simple translation tool, MandiBandhu functions as a **negotiation shield** that helps vendors:
- Understand fair market prices in real time
- Respond confidently in their own language
- Preserve dignity and long-term buyer relationships
- Avoid exploitative or below-cost offers

The system is designed to serve as the intelligence layer for a future web platform supporting local trade.

## Core Capabilities
- Multilingual communication in regional Indian languages and dialects  
- Fair price discovery using contextual price bands (distress, fair market, premium)  
- Region-specific negotiation strategies based on cultural norms  
- Voice-first and SMS-friendly design for low-literacy and feature-phone users  
- Ethical guardrails to prevent exploitative pricing  
- Confidence scoring to communicate reliability of price estimates

## Conceptual Workflow
1. Vendor speaks or types in their local language  
2. The system translates and extracts product, quantity, and buyer offer  
3. Market context is evaluated using location, seasonality, and demand patterns  
4. The offer is classified and a culturally appropriate counter-offer is generated  
5. The response is delivered in the vendor’s language in clear, respectful terms  

All interactions are designed to be fast, transparent, and practical for real market conditions.
